# Flask-SQLite App with Poetry & Docker

A simple Flask application with an embedded SQLite database, fully integrated with **Poetry** for dependency management, and optionally runnable via **Docker**. The project includes a single entry point `run.sh` that handles both Docker and native execution.

---

## Features

- Flask web application
- SQLite database with persistent `db/` folder
- Unified `run.sh` for both Docker and native execution
- Poetry-managed dependencies and virtual environment
- Configurable via optional `.env` file
- Docker support with persistent volumes
- Plug-and-play for contributors

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd flask-app
Run the application

bash
Copy code
./run.sh
If Docker is installed, the app runs in a container with SQLite persisted in db/.

If Docker is not installed, the app runs natively via Poetry in a virtual environment.

run.sh automatically installs Poetry on the native host if missing.

Optional Configuration
You can create a .env file to override default settings:

env
Copy code
# Flask
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000

# Docker
DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=flask-sqlite-app
DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME=my_flask_app
DOCKER_DETACHED=false
DOCKER_PORT_MAPPING=5000:5000
DOCKER_VOLUME_MAPPING=./db:/usr/src/app/db
The .env file is automatically loaded by run.sh.

Running with Docker
Build the Docker image

bash
Copy code
docker build -t flask-sqlite-app .
Run the Docker container

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 -v ./db:/usr/src/app/db flask-sqlite-app
run.sh automates this process if Docker is installed.

Running Natively (without Docker)
Ensure Poetry is installed:

bash
Copy code
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry --version
Install dependencies (optional, run.sh can do this automatically):

bash
Copy code
poetry install
Run Flask:

bash
Copy code
poetry run flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
Or simply:

bash
Copy code
./run.sh
Detects Docker absence and runs natively.

Notes
run.sh is executable by default (Git tracks the executable bit).

SQLite database persists in db/app.db across runs.

Works cross-platform: Linux/macOS natively, Windows via Git Bash or WSL.

Docker users donâ€™t need to manage ports or volumes manually.

Native runs automatically install Poetry if missing.

Quick Commands Reference
Action	Command
Run app	./run.sh
Run Flask locally with Poetry	poetry run flask run
